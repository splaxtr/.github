# Security Policy

We take the security of our users and data seriously. Please follow the guidelines below when reporting vulnerabilities.

## Supported versions
We currently support the latest release on `main`. Fixes are backported only when the issue is severe (critical or high impact).

## Reporting a vulnerability
- Email **security@org** with the subject `SECURITY REPORT`.
- Include a detailed description, reproduction steps, affected components, and impact assessment.
- Please do not open public issues for security reports.
- If you have an exploit or proof of concept, attach it privately and encrypt if necessary.

## Disclosure policy
- We aim to acknowledge reports within **2 business days**.
- Triage and remediation timelines depend on severity; we will keep you updated throughout the process.
- Once fixed, we will coordinate a release and public disclosure with the reporter, giving credit if desired.

Thank you for helping us keep the community safe!
